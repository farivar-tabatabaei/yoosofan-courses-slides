<pre>1. INTRODUCTION

References: Louden, Sections 5.1 to 5.3; Appel, 3.3 &amp; 3.4;
Topor &amp; Sondergaard.

Summary: An introduction to bottom-up, specifically SLR(1), parsing.

More specifically:
* How to use shift-reduce parsing tables to parse a given 
  input string.
* How to construct SLR(1) parsing tables.
* How to distinguish LR(0), SLR(1) and non-SLR(1)
  grammars.
* How to use yacc/bison.

Example 1: Grammar L for lists of a's and b's:

(1) list -&gt; list , elt
(2) list -&gt; elt
(3) elt  -&gt; a
(4) elt  -&gt; b

Construction of a sequence of partial parse trees,
stored on a stack, for input "a,b" from this grammar:

                                                         list
                                                         / | \
              list    list    list       list         list |  \
  (3)     (2)  |       |       |    (4)   |       (1)  |   |   |
  --&gt; elt --&gt; elt --&gt; elt --&gt; elt   --&gt;  elt  elt --&gt; elt  |  elt
       |       |       |       |          |    |       |   |   |
a      a       a       a ,     a , b      a ,  b       a   ,   b

Notes:
* This construction uses the actions shift, reduce(A-&gt;X1...Xn),
  accept, and error.
* The (reversed) sequence of reductions (1, 4, 2, 3) forms 
  a rightmost derivation of the input:
    list -&gt; list , elt =&gt; list , b =&gt; elt , b =&gt; a , b
  Hence the name LR parsing (Left-to-right generating Rightmost
  derivation).

2. USE OF PARSING TABLES

More formally, we can attach a state to the root of each
tree stored on the stack.  The state of the rightmost tree
is the current state.  Which action to take depends on
the current state and the next k input symbols (normally, k=1).

Parsing action table for grammar L:

State | a       b       ,           $ (eoi)
------+--------------------------------------
  0   | shift   shift
  1   |                 shift       accept
  2   |                 reduce(2)   reduce(2)
  3   |                 reduce(3)   reduce(3)
  4   |                 reduce(4)   reduce(4)
  5   | shift   shift   
  6   |                 reduce(1)   reduce(1)

($ is the end of input symbol.)
(Blank entries correspond to error actions.)

Goto table for L:

State | list    elt     a       b       ,
------+-----------------------------------
  0   | 1       2       3       4
  1   |                                 5
  2   | 
  3   | 
  4   | 
  5   |         6       3       4
  6   | 

(Blank entries are never accessed.)

Note that these two tables would be presented as a single table
by Louden:

State |           Input       |    Goto
---------------------------------------------------
      | a   b   ,       $     | list    elt
      |--------------------------------------------
  0   | s3  s4                | 1       2
  1   |         s5      accept|
  2   |         r(2)    r(2)  |
  3   |         r(3)    r(3)  |
  4   |         r(4)    r(4)  |
  5   | s3  s4                |         6
  6   |         r(1)    r(1)  |

Effect of shift and reduce actions:

Shift: If t is the current input symbol, and s is the current
    state, push the new state goto[s,t] onto the stack, and
    read the next input symbol.

Reduce (m): If rule (m) is A -&gt; X1...Xn, pop the top n states
    from the stack, let s be the state on top of the resulting
    stack, and push the new state goto[s,A] onto the stack.

Behaviour of the parsing algorithm on input "a,b$":

Input       Stack    Action
---------------------------------------
a,b$      0          shift;     goto 3
 ,b$      0 3        reduce(3); goto 2
 ,b$      0 2        reduce(2); goto 1
 ,b$      0 1        shift;     goto 5
  b$      0 1 5      shift;     goto 4
   $      0 1 5 4    reduce(4); goto 6
   $      0 1 5 6    reduce(1); goto 1
   $      0 1        accept

3. CONSTRUCTION OF PARSING TABLES

Each state corresponds to a nonempty set of items of the form
    X -&gt; u . v
where u, v, w, etc., are sequences of terminal and nonterminal
symbols.  The presence of such an item in the current state
indicates that the parser has just recognised the sequence u
and that if it next recognises the sequence v it may be able
to reduce uv to X.

Each state is constructed from a kernel (an initial set of
items) by forming its closure.  The closure C of a set B
of items is constructed as follows:

1. Let C = B.
2. Select an item X -&gt; u . Y v in C.  For each rule Y -&gt; w, 
   add the item Y -&gt; . w to C if it is not already present.
3. Repeat step (2) until all items in C have been selected.

For example, in an expression grammar, if B is the kernel 
(item set)
   exp -&gt; . term
   exp -&gt; . exp addop term
then its closure C is the state (item set)
   exp -&gt; . term
   term -&gt; . factor
   term -&gt; . term mulop factor
   factor -&gt; . number
   factor -&gt; . ( exp )

The set Q of states and the goto table is constructed as 
follows:

1. Let q0 be the closure of {S' -&gt; . S} (S' is a new symbol,
   S is the start symbol, follow(S') = {$}, and {S' -&gt; . S}
   is the kernel of q0.  Let Q = {q0}.

2. Let q in Q be any state that has not yet been examined.
   For each (terminal or nonterminal) symbol W occurring 
   to the right of "." in an item of q:
       Let B = { X -&gt; u W . v | X -&gt; u . W v in q } be the
       kernel of a possible new state.
       If B is not empty:
           Let C be the closure of B, let goto[q,W] = C,
           and add C to Q if it is not already present.

3. Repeat step (2) until all states have been examined.

For example, if q is the state (item set)
   exp -&gt; . term
   exp -&gt; . exp + term
   exp -&gt; . exp - term
   term -&gt; . factor
   ...
then, for the symbol W = exp, B is the kernel (item set)
   exp -&gt; exp . + term
   exp -&gt; exp . - term
and the closure C of B is itself, so the goto table contains
the entry
   goto[q,exp] = C.

Finally, the parsing action table entries for each 
state q in Q are constructed as follows:

1. For each item A -&gt; u . t v in q, where t is a terminal 
   symbol, the parsing action is t -&gt; shift.
2. For each item A -&gt; u . in q, the parsing action is 
   t -&gt; reduce(A -&gt; u) for each t in follow(A).
3. If item S' -&gt; u . in q, the parsing action is $ -&gt; accept.
4. For every other terminal symbol, the parsing action is 
   error.

If we apply this table construction algorithm to grammar L,
the resulting table (with states shown) is as follows:

State   Set of items            Goto            Action
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  0     S' -&gt; . list            list -&gt; 1
        list -&gt; . list , elt
        list -&gt; . elt           elt -&gt; 2
        elt -&gt; . a              a -&gt; 3          a -&gt; shift
        elt -&gt; . b              b -&gt; 4          b -&gt; shift
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  1     S' -&gt; list .                            $ -&gt; accept
        list -&gt; list . , elt    , -&gt; 5          , -&gt; shift
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  2     list -&gt; elt .                           ,$ -&gt; reduce(2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  3     elt -&gt; a .                              ,$ -&gt; reduce(3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  4     elt -&gt; b .                              ,$ -&gt; reduce(4)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  5     list -&gt; list , . elt    elt -&gt; 6
        elt -&gt; . a              a -&gt; 3          a -&gt; shift
        elt -&gt; . b              b -&gt; 4          b -&gt; shift
-----------------------------------------------------------------
  6     list -&gt; list , elt .                    ,$ -&gt; reduce(1)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

(Note that this is equivalent to the parsing action and goto
tables shown above.)

4. SLR(1) GRAMMARS

If each (completed) item A -&gt; u (where A is not S') is the 
_only_ item in its state, the grammar is called LR(0).  In 
this case, no lookahead is ever required to decide whether  
to shift or reduce.

Two types of conflicts are possible:

1. Shift/reduce conflicts occur when a state contains items
       A -&gt; u . t b, and
       B -&gt; u .
   This occurs for example with the items:
       S -&gt; if ( E ) S . else S
       S -&gt; if ( E ) S .
    (Yacc always resolves such conflicts in favour of shift.)

2. Reduce/reduce conflicts occur when a state contains items
       A -&gt; u .
       B -&gt; v .
   This occurs for example with the items:
       factor -&gt; id .
       factor -&gt; id . args
       args -&gt; .
       args -&gt; . ( exprs )

(Shift/shift conflicts are not possible.  Why?)

If no such conflicts occur, the grammar is called SLR(1)
(Simple LR with 1 symbol lookahead), and the parser is called
an SLR(1) parser.

If a conflict does occur when follow(A) is used as above,
the grammar is not SLR(1).  However, if no conflicts occur
when the _exact right context_ for each item is used, the
grammar is LALR(1).  

(The construction of LALR(1) parsing tables is not required
for this course.)

Every SLR(1) grammar is also an LALR(1) grammar,
LALR(1) parsers have relatively few states. Most practical
programming language grammars are LALR(1).  Most practical
parser generator tools (e.g., Yacc/Bison) construct LALR(1)
parsers.

There exist grammars that are LL(1) but not LALR(1) (and hence
not SLR(1)).  Conversely, there exist grammars that are SLR(1)
(and hence LALR(1)) but not LL(1).

The tutorial exercises will explore the differences between
these classes of grammars through concrete examples.

5. EXAMPLES

Example 2: Grammar for balanced parenthesis strings
(Louden, Example 5.3):

(1) S' -&gt; S
(2) S  -&gt; ( S ) S
(3) S  -&gt; 

State   Set of items        Goto            Action
------------------------------------------------------------
  0     S' -&gt; . S           S -&gt; 1
        S  -&gt; . ( S )       ( -&gt; 2          ( -&gt; shift
        S  -&gt; .                             )$ -&gt; reduce(3)
 ------------------------------------------------------------
  1     S' -&gt; S .                           $ -&gt; accept
-------------------------------------------------------------
  2     S -&gt; ( . S ) S      S -&gt; 3        
        S -&gt; . ( S ) S      ( -&gt; 2          ( -&gt; shift
        S -&gt; .                              )$ -&gt; reduce(3)
-------------------------------------------------------------
  3     S -&gt; ( S . ) S      ) -&gt; 4          ) -&gt; shift
-------------------------------------------------------------
  4     S -&gt; ( S ) . S      S -&gt; 5                   
        S -&gt; . ( S ) S      ( -&gt; 2          ( -&gt; shift
        S -&gt; .                              )$ -&gt; reduce(3)
-------------------------------------------------------------
  5     S -&gt; ( S ) S .                      )$ -&gt; reduce(2)
-------------------------------------------------------------

See Figure 5.3 for the state and goto entries and Table 5.7
for the action entries.  This is an SLR(1) grammar.

Exercise: Use this table to parse the input "(())()".

Example 3: Grammar for expressions

(1) S' -&gt; exp
(2) exp -&gt; exp addop term
(3) exp -&gt; term
(4) term -&gt; term mulop factor
(5) term -&gt; factor
(6) factor -&gt; ( exp )
(7) factor -&gt; number
(8) addop -&gt; +
(9) addop -&gt; -
(10) mulop -&gt; *
(11) mulop -&gt; /

This grammar is SLR(1) (but not LL(1)).

Example 4: Grammar for statements
(Cf. Louden, Example 5.13)

(1) stmt -&gt; id := exp
(2) stmt -&gt; id ( exp-list )
(3) exp -&gt; 0
(4) exp -&gt; 1
(5) exp-list -&gt; exp-list , exp
(6) exp-list -&gt; exp

This grammar is not SLR(1) (or LL(1)), but it is LALR(1).

Examples 3 and 4 require grammar transformations (which may
distort their semantics) to make them LL(1).

6. PARSER GENERATORS

References: Louden, Section 5.5

Tools exist for both top-down and bottom-up parser generation, 
but bottom-up generators are much more widely used.

Yacc (yet another compiler compiler) was written
by Steven Johnson at Bell Laboratories in 1975.

Bison (available from http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
is a GNU extension of Yacc written by Robert Corbett
and Richard Stallman ca. 1985.

Both of these tools generate parsers in C and require 
lexical and semantic components to be written in C.  They
come by default with most Unix and GNU/Linux installations.

JavaCC (Java compiler compiler, started at Sun, now
available from https://javacc.dev.java.net/) is the most 
mature and widely used compiler compiler for Java programmers.

CUP (Construction of useful parsers) is an alternative
Java tool written at Princeton University and now maintained
at TU Munich (http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/).

Lalr-scm is an efficient and portable LALR(1) parser 
generator for Scheme (based loosely on yacc but without
lex).

Eli (available from http://eli-project.sourceforge.net/)  
is a very comprehensive set of tools for compiler 
construction, based on C, that includes two bottom-up
parser generators.

We focus on Yacc/Bison.

The format of a Yacc input file, e.g., grammar.y, is 
as follows:

    (C and Yacc) definitions
    %%
    Grammar rules (and semantic actions)
    %%
    Auxiliary C function definitions, e.g. for lexical analysis

To generate a parser from a Yacc input file, grammar.y,
use one of the following commands:

    yacc [options] grammar.y
    bison [options] grammar.y

Yacc (resp., bison) generates a C file y.tab.c (resp., 
grammar.tab.c) (the "tab" is for parsing table), which can 
be compiled by a C compiler.

Study the file <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/parens.y">parens.y</a> as a very simple example of a yacc 
specification for recognising balanced parenthesis strings.

Study the file <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/calc.y">calc.y</a> as an example of a simple arithmetic 
expression calculator.  (File <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/calc.data">calc.data</a> contains some sample 
data.)

Notes: 
0.  %{ ... %} code is included in the generated C file.
1.  %token declares a list of tokens.
2.  Semantic actions (C code) may follow each RHS.
3.  In semantic actions, $$ refers to the computed value,
    $1 refers to the value of the first RHS symbol, $2 to 
    the value of the second $RHS symbol, etc.  (These
    are the values stored on the stack parallel to the
    state stack.)
4.  Yacc generates a parsing function called yyparse().
5.  This parser calls a lexical analysis function called
    yylex(), which returns its value in the variable yylval.
6.  Parsing errors are reported by the function yyerror().
7.  By default, the LHS symbol of the first grammar rule
    is the start symbol of the grammar. but we can use:
        %start <symbol>
    to override this default.
8.  yacc -d creates a (useful) y.tab.h file, which can be
    in other files of a compiler.
9.  yacc -v (resp., bison -v) creates a y.output (resp., 
    grammar.output) file containing a human readable form 
    of the parsing table.  This table should to be studied 
    when parsing conflicts occur.
10. Operator associativity and relative precedence can 
    be easily specified, e.g.:
        %left '+' '-'
        %left '*' '/'
    specifies that the four operators are left associative
    and that '*' and '/' have higher precedence than '+'
    and '-'.  This is useful in simpler rules such as
        exp : exp '+' exp | exp '-' exp | ... | NUMBER ;
11. We may specify non-integer value types as follows:
        #define YYSTYPE double
12. If different symbols have different value types, we
    need to use a C union, e.g.,
        %union { double val; char op; }
    and specify which grammar symbols have which value 
    types, e.g.,
        %type <val> exp term factor NUMBER
        %type <op> addop mulop
13. In real parsers, which construct parse trees, the value
    types are pointers to tree nodes.

Study the files <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/calc2.l">calc2.l</a>, <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/calc2.y">calc2.y</a> and <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/Makefile">Makefile</a> to see
how flex and bison are used together.

Files <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/cppcalc/calc3.l">calc3.l</a>, <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/cppcalc/calc3.y">calc3.y</a> and <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/exx/cppcalc/Makefile3">Makefile3</a> are a C++ solution 
to the same problem.

Now study the files <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/TinyCompiler/globals.h">globals.h</a> and <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/TinyCompiler/yacc/tiny.y">tiny.y</a> from the TINY
compiler as a more realistic example.

Compare this parser specification with the recursive
descent implementation <a href="https://www.ict.griffith.edu.au/teaching/3516ICT/Resources/TinyCompiler/parse.c">parse.c</a> of the same language.
