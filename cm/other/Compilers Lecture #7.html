<h1>Compilers</h1>

<p class="startLecture">Start Lecture #7</p> <!-- MARKER -->

<p><strong>Remark</strong>: Lab 3 assigned.
  Part 1 (no programming) due in one week; the remainder due a week
  later.

</p><h4>Use of the LR(0) Automaton</h4>
<p>A state of the automaton is an item set as described previously.
  The transition function is GOTO.
  If during a parse we are up to item set I<sub>j</sub> (often called
  state s<sub>j</sub> or simply state j) and the next input symbol is
  b (it of course must be a terminal), then the parser shifts in b if
  the state j has an outgoing transition labeled b.
  If there is no such transition, then the parser performs a
  reduction; choosing which reduction to use is determined by the
  items in I<sub>j</sub> and the FOLLOW sets.
  (It is also possible that the parser will now accept the input
  string or announce that the input string is not in the language).</p>

<h3>4.6.3: The LR-Parsing Algorithm</h3>
<p>The LR-parsing algorithm must decide when to shift and when to
  reduce (and in the latter case, by which production).
  It does this by consulting two tables, ACTION and GOTO.
  The basic algorithm is the same for all LR parsers, what changes are
  the tables ACTION and GOTO.</p>

<h4>The LR Parsing Tables</h4>
<p>We have already seen GOTO (for SLR).
  </p><blockquote class="optional">
    Technical point that may, and probably should, be ignored: our GOTO
    was defined on pairs [item-set,grammar-symbol].
    The new GOTO is defined on pairs [state,nonterminal].
    A state is simply an item set (so nothing is new here).
    We will not use the new GOTO on terminals so we just define it on
    nonterminals.
  </blockquote>
<p>Given a state i and a terminal a (or the endmarker), ACTION[i,a]
  can be
  </p><ol>
    <li>Shift j.
      The terminal a is shifted on to the stack and the parser enters
      state j.
    </li><li>Reduce A → α.
      The parser reduces α on the TOS to A.
    </li><li>Accept.
    </li><li>Error
  </li></ol>
<p>So ACTION is the key to deciding shift vs. reduce.
  We will soon see how this table is computed for SLR.
</p><p>Since ACTION is defined on [state,terminal] pairs and GOTO is
  defined on [state,nonterminal] pairs, we can combine these tables
  into one defined on [state,grammar-symbol] pairs.</p>

<h4>LR-Parser Configurations (formalism)</h4>
<p>This formalism is useful for stating the actions of the parser
  precisely, but I believe the parser can be explained without this
  formalism.
  The essential idea of the formalism is that the entire state of the
  parser can be represented by the vector of states on the stack
  and input symbols not yet processed.</p>
<div class="optional">
  <p>As mentioned above the Symbols column is redundant so a
    configuration of the parser consists of the current stack and the
    remainder of the input.
    Formally it is
    </p><div align="center">
      (s<sub>0</sub>,s<sub>1</sub>...s<sub>m</sub>,a<sub>i</sub>a<sub>i+1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>$)
    </div>
    where the s's are states and the a's input symbols.
    This configuration could also be represented by the
    right-sentential form
    <div align="center">
      X<sub>1</sub>...X<sub>m</sub>,a<sub>i</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>
    </div>
    where the X is the symbol associated with the state.
    X is either the terminal just shifted in or the LHS of the
    reduction just performed.
</div>

<h4>Behavior of the LR Parser</h4>
<p>The parser consults the combined ACTION-GOTO table for its current
  state (TOS) and next input symbol, formally this is
  ACTION[s<sub>m</sub>,a<sub>i</sub>], and proceeds based on the value
  in the table.
  If the action is a shift, the next state is clear from the DFA
  We have done this informally just above; here we use the formal
  treatment).
  </p><ol>
    <li>Shift s.
      The input symbol a is pushed and s becomes the new state.
      The new configuration is
      <div>
	(s<sub>0</sub>...s<sub>m</sub>s,a<sub>i+1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>)
      </div>
    </li><li>Reduce A → α.
      Let r be the number of symbols in the RHS of the production.
      The parser pops r items off the stack (backing up r states) and
      enters the state GOTO(s<sub>m-r</sub>,A).
      That is after backing up it goes where A says to go.
      A real parser would now probably do something, e.g., build a
      tree node or perform a semantic action.
      Although we know about this from the chapter 2 overview, we
      don't officially know about it here.
      So for now think of it simply printing the production the parser
      reduced by.
    </li><li>Accept.
    </li><li>Error.
  </li></ol>
<p></p>

<h3>4.6.4 Constructing SLR-Parsing Tables</h3>
<p>The missing piece of the puzzle is finally revealed.</p>

<h4>A Simple (but fake) Example</h4>

<img src="Compilers%20Lecture%20%237_files/lr0-simple.png" alt="lr0-simple" class="right">
  <table class="left" frame="box" rules="all">
    <tbody><tr><th>State</th><th>a</th><th>b</th><th>+</th><th>$</th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>C</th></tr>
    <tr><td>7</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>acc</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>8</td><td>s11</td><td>s10</td><td></td><td></td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>9</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>10</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>11</td><td></td><td></td><td>s12</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>12</td><td></td><td>s13</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
    <tr><td>13</td><td></td><td>r2</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
  </tbody></table>

<p>Before defining the ACTION and GOTO tables precisely, I want to do
  it informally via the simple example on the right.
  This is a <strong>FAKE</strong> example, the B'→B· item
  would be in I<sub>0</sub> and would have only B→·a+b
  with it.
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: To construct the table, you do need
  something not in the diagram, namely the FOLLOW sets from top-down
  parsing.
</p><p>For convenience number the productions of the grammar to make them
  easy to reference and assume that the production B → a+b is
  numbered 2.
  Also assume FOLLOW(B)={b} and all other follow sets are empty.
  Again, I am not claiming that there is a grammar with this diagram
  and these FOLLOW sets.
</p><p>Show how to calculate every entry in the table using the diagram
  and the FOLLOW sets.
  Then consider input <q>a+b</q> and 
</p><p>The action table is defined with states (item sets) as rows and
  <strong>terminals</strong> and the $ endmarker as columns.
  GOTO has the same rows, but has <strong>nonterminals</strong> as
  columns.
  So we construct a combined ACTION-GOTO table, with states as rows
  and grammar symbols (terminals + nonterminals) plus $ as columns.
  </p><ol>
    <li>Each arc in the diagram labeled with a terminal indicates a
      shift.
      In the entry with row the state at the tail of the arc and
      column the labeling terminal place sn, where n is the state at
      the head of the arc.
      This indicates that if we are in the given state and the input
      is the given terminal, we shift to new state n.
    </li><li>Each arc in the diagram labeled with a nonterminal informs us
      what state to enter if we reduce.
      In the entry with row the state at the tail of the arc and
      column the labeling nonterminal place n, where n is the state
      at the head of the arc.
    </li><li>Each completed item (dot at the extreme right) indicates
      a <strong>possible</strong> reduction.
      In each entry with row the state containing the completed
      item and column a terminal in the FOLLOW set of the LHS of
      the production corresponding to this item, place rn, where n is
      the number of the production.
      (In particular, at entry [13,b] place an r2.).
    </li><li>In the entry with row (i.e., state) containing S'→S and
      column $, place <q>accept</q>.
    </li><li>If any entry is labelled twice (i.e., a conflict) the grammar
      is not SLR(1).
    </li><li>Any unlabeled entry corresponds to an input error.
      If the parser accesses this entry, the input sentence is not in
      the language generated by the grammar.
  </li></ol>
<p></p>

<div class="optional">
  <h4>A Terminology Point</h4>
  <p>The book (both editions) and the rest of the world seem to use GOTO
    for both the function defined on item sets and the derived function
    on states.
    As a result we will be defining GOTO in terms of GOTO.
    Item sets are denoted by I or I<sub>j</sub>, etc.
    States are denoted by s or s<sub>i</sub> or i.
    Indeed both books use i in this section.
    The advantage is that on the stack we placed integers (i.e., i's) so
    this is consistent.
    The disadvantage is that we are defining GOTO(i,A) in terms of
    GOTO(I<sub>i</sub>,A), which looks confusing.
    Actually, we view the old GOTO as a function and the new one as an
    array (mathematically, they are the same) so we actually write
    GOTO(i,A) and GOTO[I<sub>i</sub>,A].
</p></div>

<h4>The Table Construction Algorithm</h4>
<p>The diagrams above are constructed for our use; they are not used in
  constructing a bottom-up parser.
  Here is the real algorithm, which uses just the augmented grammar
  (i.e., after adding S' → S) and the FOLLOW sets.
  </p><ol>
    <li>Construct {I<sub>0</sub>,...,I<sub>n</sub>} the LR(0) items.
    </li><li>The parsing actions for state i.
      <ol type="a">
	<li>If A→α·bβ is in I<sub>i</sub> for
	  b a terminal, then ACTION[i,b]=<q>shift&nbsp;j</q>, where
	  GOTO(I<sub>i</sub>,b)=I<sub>j</sub>.
	</li><li>If A→α· is in I<sub>i</sub>, for
	  A≠S', then, for all b in FOLLOW(A),
	  ACTION[i,b]=<q>reduce&nbsp;A→α</q>.
	</li><li>If S'→S· is in I<sub>i</sub>, then
	  ACTION[I,$]=<q>accept</q>.
	</li><li>If any conflicts occurred, the grammar is not SLR(1).
      </li></ol>
    </li><li>If GOTO(I<sub>i</sub>,A)=I<sub>j</sub>, for a nonterminal A,
      then GOTO[i,A]=j.
    </li><li>All entries not yet defined are <q>error</q>.
    </li><li>The initial state is the one containing S'→·S.
  </li></ol>

<p>Our main example, pictured on the right, gives the table shown on
  the left.
  The productions and FOLLOW sets are shown as well (the FIRST sets
  are not used directly, but are needed to calculate FOLLOW).
  The table entry s5 abbreviates <q>shift and go to state 5</q>.
  The table entry r2 abbreviates <q>reduce by production number 2</q>,
  where we have numbered the productions as follows.
</p><p>The shift actions can be read directly off the DFA.
  For example I1 with a + goes to I6, I6 with an id goes to I5, and I9
  with a * goes to I7.
</p><p>The reduce actions require FOLLOW, which for this simple grammar is
  fairly easy to calculate.
  </p><p>Consider I<sub>5</sub>={F→id·}.
  Since the dot is at the end, we are ready to reduce, but we must
  check if the next symbol can follow the F we are reducing to.
  Since FOLLOW(F)={+,*,),$}, in row 5 (for I5) we put
  r6 (for <q>reduce by production 6</q>) in the columns for
  +, *, ), and $.
</p><p>The GOTO columns can also be read directly off the DFA.
  Since there is an E-transition (arc labeled E) from I<sub>0</sub>
  to I<sub>1</sub>, the column labeled E in row 0 contains a 1.
</p><p>Since the column labeled + is blank for row 7, we see that it would
  be an error if we arrived in state 7 when the next input character
  is +.
</p><p>Finally, if we are in state 1 when the input is exhausted ($ is the
  next input character), then we have a successfully parsed the
  input.

  <strong>Example</strong>:
  The diagram on the right shows the actions when SLR is parsing
  id*id+id.
  On the blackboard let's do id+id*id and see how the precedence is
  handled.
</p><p><strong>Homework</strong>: 2 (you already constructed the LR(0)
  automaton for this example in the previous homework), 3,
  4 (this problem refers to 4.2.2(a-g); only use 4.2.2(a-c).
</p><p><strong>Example</strong>:
  What about ε-productions?
  Let's do
  </p><pre>    A → B D
    B → b B | ε
    D → d
  </pre>
<p>Reducing by the ε-production actually adds a state to the
  stack (it pops ZERO states since there are zero symbols on RHS and
  pushes one).
</p><p><strong>Homework</strong>: Do the following extension
  </p><pre>    A → B D
    B → b B | ε
    D → d D | ε

<h3>4.6.5: Viable Prefixes</h3>

<h2>4.7: More Powerful LR Parsers</h2>
<p>We consider <b>very</b> briefly two alternatives to SLR,
  canonical-LR or LR, and lookahead-LR or LALR.</p>

<h3>4.7.1: Canonical LR(1) Items</h3>
<p>SLR used the LR(0) items, that is the items used were productions
  with an embedded dot, but contained no other (lookahead)
  information.
  The LR(1) items contain the same productions with embedded dots, but
  add a second component, which is a terminal (or $).
  This second component becomes important only when the dot is at the
  extreme right (indicating that a reduction can be made if the input
  symbol is in the appropriate FOLLOW set).
  For LR(1) we do that reduction only if the input symbol is exactly
  the second component of the item.
  This finer control of when to perform reductions, enables the
  parsing of a larger class of languages.</p>

<div class="optional">
  <h3>4.7.2: Constructing LR(1) Sets of Items</h3>

  <h3>4.7.3: Canonical LR(1) Parsing Tables</h3>
</div>

<h3>4.7.4: Constructing LALR Parsing Tables</h3>
<p>For LALR we merge various LR(1) item sets together, obtaining nearly
  the LR(0) item sets we used in SLR.
  LR(1) items have two components, the first, called the core, is a
  production with a dot; the second a terminal.
  For LALR we merge all the item sets that have the same cores by
  combining the 2nd components (thus permitting reductions when any of
  these terminals is the next input symbol).
  Thus we obtain the same number of states (item sets) as in SLR since
  only the cores distinguish item sets.
</p><p>Unlike SLR, we limit reductions to occurring only for certain
  specified input symbols.
  LR(1) gives finer control; it is possible for the LALR merger to
  have reduce-reduce conflicts when the LR(1) items on which it is
  based is conflict free.
</p><p>Although these conflicts are possible, they are rare and the size
  reduction from LR(1) to LALR is quite large.
  LALR is the current method of choice for bottom-up, shift-reduce
  parsing.</p>

<p>The tool corresponding to Lex for parsing is yacc, which (at least
  originally) stood for yet another compiler compiler.
  This name is cute but somewhat misleading since yacc (like the
  previous compiler compilers) does not produce a compiler, just a
  parser.
</p><p>The structure of the yacc user input is similar to that for lex,
  but instead of regular definitions, one includes productions with
  semantic actions.
</p><p>There are ways to specify associativity and precedence of
  operators.
  It is not done with multiple grammar symbols as in a pure parser,
  but more like declarations.
</p><p>Use of Yacc requires a serious session with its manual.</p>
